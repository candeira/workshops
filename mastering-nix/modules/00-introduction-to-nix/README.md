(NOTE TO GEOFF: TEMPTED TO JUST COPY chunks the NixOS about page here, I think it's CC 4.0 as well)

Notes:
- NixOS is a source-based distribution. There are binary packages, but these are considered to be just "cached builds", and are not first-class objects as they are, for instance, in Debian.

Glossary:
- Nix means three things:
  - The package manager and its ecosystem: `The Nix package manager`
  - The language: `Nix` or `nixlang``xq`
  - The executable (we'll call it `nix-lang`)
- nixpkgs
- nixos
- nixops
- substituters
- expression
- derivation
- "sets" as understood in nix language are unordered collections of key value pairs. Quick explain of sets and recursive sets.
